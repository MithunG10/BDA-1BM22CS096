| 2           | Perform the following DB operations using Cassandra.<br> a) Create a keyspace by name Employee<br> b) Create a column family by name Employee-info with attributes... (and more) |
| 3           | Perform the following DB operations using Cassandra.<br> a) Create a keyspace by name Library<br> b) Create a column family by name Library-info with attributes... (and more)    |
| 4           | Execution of HDFS Commands for interaction with Hadoop Environment. (Minimum 10 commands to be executed)                                                                      |
| 5           | Implement Wordcount program on Hadoop framework                                                                                                                                 |
| 6           | From the following link extract the weather data https://github.com/tomwhite/hadoop-book/blob/master/input/ncdc/all... (and more)                                               |
| 7           | For a given Text file, Create a Map Reduce program to sort the content in an alphabetic order listing only top 10 maximum occurrences of words.                               |
| 8           | Write a Scala program to print numbers from 1 to 100 using for loop.                                                                                                             |
| 9           | Using RDD and FlatMap count how many times each word appears in a file and write out a list of words whose count is strictly greater than 4 using Spark.                      |
| 10          | Write a simple streaming program in Spark to receive text data streams on a particular port, perform basic text cleaning (like white space removal, stop words removal, lemmatization, etc.), and print the cleaned text on the screen. (Open Ended Question). |
